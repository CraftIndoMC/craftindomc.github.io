## About
I was eager to start a new project and didn't know what to start on. After finding Google's [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/), I had gotten an instant urge of inspiration. I immediately started working on MaterialCraft.

If you're not too familiar with HTML and CSS, you should probably either familiarize yourself, or hire someone to customize the template for you. The template has been made as easy to customize as possible, but there's only so much I can do.

## Features
##### Server Status
MaterialCraft comes equipt with a fast and reliable server info-grabber. It pulls it's status, and player count within a second or two after loading the page.

##### Twitter Widget
Packed with a simple twitter widget, to pull your server's latest tweets from.


##### BuyCraft Iframe Integration
Turn your players, into donators. With the easy iframe integration on the store page you can both process transactions, and keep users on your site.

##### Privacy Policy Page
Pre-made with a simple Privacy Policy page. All you need to do is fill in a few fields.

## Future Plans
- Prettier staff page.
- Automatic Donation Goal %.
- Easier to customize content.

## Extra
